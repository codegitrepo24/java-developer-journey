# Problem Statement: Find the Area of a Rectangle

## Description:
Take the length (L) and breadth (B) of a rectangle as input and calculate its area.

### Notes:
- The length and breadth must be **integer** values.
- The calculated area will always be an integer.
- The formula to calculate the area of a rectangle is: 
  \[
  \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Breadth}
  \]

## Constraints:
- \( 1 \leq L, B \leq 10^2 \)

## Input Format:
- Two space-separated integers representing the length (L) and breadth (B) of the rectangle.

## Output Format:
- A single integer representing the area of the rectangle.

## Sample Input 1:
 4 20

## Sample Output 1:

80


## Explanation:
- The length of the rectangle is 4 and the breadth is 20. 
- Hence, the area of the rectangle is \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \).
