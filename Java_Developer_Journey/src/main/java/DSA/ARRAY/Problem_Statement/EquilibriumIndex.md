# Equilibrium Index of an Array

## Problem Statement

You are given an array `Arr` consisting of `N` integers. You need to find the **equilibrium index** of the array.

An index is considered an **equilibrium index** if the sum of elements of the array to the left of that index is equal to the sum of elements to the right of it.

### Conditions
1. The array follows **0-based indexing**, so you need to return the **0-based index** of the element.
2. Note that the element at the equilibrium index wonâ€™t be considered for either left sum or right sum.
3. If there are multiple indices which satisfy the given condition, return the **left-most index**. That is, if there are indices `i, j, k...` which are equilibrium indices, return the **smallest** among them.
4. If no such index is present in the array, return `-1`.

## Detailed Explanation

### Constraints
- `1 <= T <= 50` (Number of test cases)
- `1 <= N <= 10^5` (Array length)
- `-10^4 <= Arr[i] <= 10^4` (Array elements)
- **Time Limit**: 1 second per test case.

### Sample Input/Output

#### Input 1:
```
1
6
1 7 3 6 5 6
```

#### Output 1:
```
3
```

#### Explanation:
For the array `[1, 7, 3, 6, 5, 6]`, the sum of elements to the left of `arr[3]` (i.e., `1 + 7 + 3 = 11`) is equal to the sum of elements to the right of `arr[3]` (i.e., `5 + 6 = 11`).

Hence, the equilibrium index is `3`.

#### Input 2:
```
2
6
1 2 2 9 3 2
4
1 2 3 4
```

#### Output 2:
```
3
-1
```

#### Explanation:
For the first test case, the sum of elements on the left of index `3` (i.e., `1 + 2 + 2 = 5`) is equal to the sum of elements on the right of index `3` (i.e., `3 + 2 = 5`), so the equilibrium index is `3`.

For the second test case, no equilibrium index exists, so the result is `-1`.

## Approach

1. **Initial Considerations**:
   - A brute force solution where we calculate the left and right sums for each index will have a time complexity of `O(N^2)`, which is inefficient for large arrays (up to `10^5` elements).
   
2. **Optimal Solution**:
   - We can use a more efficient approach by maintaining the **total sum** of the array and iterating through it to find the equilibrium index:
     - Calculate the **total sum** of the array.
     - Use two variables: `leftSum` (sum of elements before the current index) and `rightSum` (calculated dynamically by subtracting `leftSum` and the current element from `totalSum`).
     - Compare `leftSum` and `rightSum` for each index.
     - If they are equal, return the index as the equilibrium index.
     - Otherwise, update `leftSum += arr[i]`.
   
3. **Algorithm**:
   1. Calculate the **total sum** of the array.
   2. Initialize `leftSum` as `0`.
   3. Traverse the array:
      - Calculate `rightSum = totalSum - leftSum - arr[i]`.
      - If `leftSum == rightSum`, return the current index as the equilibrium index.
      - Otherwise, update `leftSum += arr[i]`.
   4. If no equilibrium index is found, return `-1`.
