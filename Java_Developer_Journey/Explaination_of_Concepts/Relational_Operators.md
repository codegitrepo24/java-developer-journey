# Relational Operators in Java

In Java, relational operators are used to compare two values or expressions. These comparisons return a boolean result: `true` or `false`. Relational operators are essential when implementing conditional logic in programs.

## List of Relational Operators

| Operator   | Symbol | Description                                                       |
|------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Equal to   | `==`   | Checks if two values are equal. Returns `true` if they are equal, otherwise `false`. |
| Not equal to | `!=`   | Checks if two values are not equal. Returns `true` if they are not equal, otherwise `false`. |
| Greater than | `>`    | Checks if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right. |
| Less than  | `<`    | Checks if the value on the left is less than the value on the right. |
| Greater than or equal to | `>=`   | Checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right. |
| Less than or equal to | `<=`   | Checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right. |

## Syntax


// Example of relational operators usage
int a = 10;
int b = 20;

boolean result;

result = (a == b);   // Equal to
result = (a != b);   // Not equal to
result = (a > b);    // Greater than
result = (a < b);    // Less than
result = (a >= b);   // Greater than or equal to
result = (a <= b);   // Less than or equal to


## Description of Relational Operators

1. **Equal to (`==`)**:
   - This operator checks whether the two operands are equal.
   - Example: `if (a == b)` checks if `a` is equal to `b`.

2. **Not equal to (`!=`)**:
   - This operator checks whether the two operands are not equal.
   - Example: `if (a != b)` checks if `a` is not equal to `b`.

3. **Greater than (`>`)**:
   - This operator checks whether the left operand is greater than the right operand.
   - Example: `if (a > b)` checks if `a` is greater than `b`.

4. **Less than (`<`)**:
   - This operator checks whether the left operand is less than the right operand.
   - Example: `if (a < b)` checks if `a` is less than `b`.

5. **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**:
   - This operator checks whether the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
   - Example: `if (a >= b)` checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.

6. **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**:
   - This operator checks whether the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
   - Example: `if (a <= b)` checks if `a` is less than or equal to `b`.
