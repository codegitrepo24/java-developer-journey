# How to Run a Java Program

## Introduction
Java is an object-oriented language with features like automatic memory management, multi-threading, and a vast standard library. It is open-source and widely used for web and mobile applications. Java programs run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making them portable across platforms.

## Steps to Run a Java Program in Command Prompt

### 1. Install JDK
- Download the Java Development Kit (JDK) from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- Set the JDK path in system environment variables.

### 2. Use a Text Editor
- Open Notepad or any text editor.
- Write your Java program and save it with a `.java` extension (e.g., `HelloWorld.java`).

### 3. Compile the Program
- Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where your `.java` file is saved using the `cd` command.
- Compile the program using:
  
  javac HelloWorld.java

### 4.  Run the Program
 - Run the compiled program using

   java HelloWorld

 - You should see the program's output.

### Additional Options
 - You can use online Java compilers or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans to 
   write and run Java programs more easily.
