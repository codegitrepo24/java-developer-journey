# Introduction to Variables in Java

Programs perform tasks like storing, manipulating, or printing data. Variables are containers that temporarily store data values during program execution. The space allocated to a variable depends on its data type.

## Variables in Java

Variables, also known as identifiers, follow these naming conventions:

- Variable names can include alphanumeric characters, underscores (`_`), and dollar signs (`$`).
- They must start with a letter and are case-sensitive.
- Whitespaces and keywords are not allowed.

## Declaration

Declaration introduces a variable to the program, specifying its name and type. A variableâ€™s type cannot change once declared.

## Types of Variables in Java


### 1. Local Variables
 - Declared within methods or blocks.
Used only within the block they are declared in and discarded after.
### 2. Static Variables
 - Declared with the static keyword.
 - Belong to the class rather than a specific object.
 - Shared among all instances of the class.
### 3. Instance Variables
 - Declared in a class but outside methods or blocks.
 - Form part of the class and have default values.
 - Accessed only through objects.
